TELEGRAM-E-HENTAI-BOT

A python telegram bot tracking e-hentai/exhentai galleries and sending them to specified channel.

ENVIRONMENT AND PYTHON VERSION
Tested OS: UBUNTU 16.04
I have only tested this program on Ubuntu 16.04 (deploy it on Ubuntu 14.04 might encounter some strange UNICODE errors).

Python version: 3.5 or above

PRE-REQUEST
This program relies on several third-party python modules.

BASIC USAGE FOR BOT ADMIN

1. Apply a bot at @BotFather on telegram. Then copy the token to token variable in tgbotmodules/botconfig.py.

2. Create a private channel and add the bot created before as the admin. After that exploit some specified bots (like @getidsbot) to gain the channel ID. Once gained this ID, copy it to the pubChannelID variable in tgbotmodules/botconfig.py.

3. RECOMMENDATION-View two separate config files (tgbotmodules/botconfig.py and tgbotmodules/spidermodules/generalcfg.py) to modify the running process of the bot. 
(Since the history reason, this program has two config files to control different parts of it. I would fix it later.)

4. Run tgexhbot_tg.py

5. Now exploit telegram to access your bot and add the search profiles. This bot would access e-hentai/exhentai to search the galleries at a specified interval then send the result to users' own channel and (if user allowed) bot admins' channel.

This bot contains a step by step guide to help users creating their search profiles. For more information, please access the profile creating process and follow the instructions.

If you hope to run this bot on servers' background, please use systemd to create a service.
